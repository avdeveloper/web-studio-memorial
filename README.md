# Design your digital memorial
For class, we had to design our own digital tombstone. Sounds depressing, but it was actually quite fun to put into practice cool new CSS3 animations

## Topics/Technoligies learned
* project inspired by <http://www.aisleone.net/2010/design/designing-for-the-dead/>
* learned jQuery.animate function
* self-discovered how to use transparent images to mask content underneath
* explored LESS for CSS

## WARNING: Take note that there are some bad practices in this code
* Too many images on the page!
* Does not take advantage of CSS3 animation
* Not as semantic as I would have liked
